# Overview

The VISR Production Suite is the first open-source set of DAW plugins for producing and reproducing object-based audio.

It consists of an audio object editor to transform your tracks into audio objects, a scene editor to manipulate the whole object-based audio scene, and integrated renderers to reproduce the audio scene on various loudspeaker layouts, sound bars and headphones.

What you can do with the VISR Production Suite:

* Create an object-based session

* Spatialise and control your audio objects

* Easy binaural content creation with different sets of HRIR and BRIRs in SOFA format

* Head tracking and head orientation compensation capabilities, suitable for VR

* Create loudspeaker layout agnostic spatial audio content and render it for different loudspeaker systems with just one click

* Exploit JUCE framework and the VISR, a modular open-source framework for audio processing

Development of this project has been supported by the EPSRC Programme Grant S3A: Future Spatial Audio for an Immersive Listener Experience at Home (EP/L000539/1) http://www.s3a-spatialaudio.org and the BBC as part of the BBC Audio Research Partnership.
