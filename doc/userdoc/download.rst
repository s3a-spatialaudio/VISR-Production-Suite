Installation packages are available for the following platforms:

  **Windows (x86_64)**
    Recent versions (Windows 8 and Windows 10) 64 Bit only

  **Mac OS X**
    Version 10.9 and above

Download the VISR Production Suite installer from the `download page <http://www.s3a-spatialaudio.org/plugins>`_ .

.. note:: One of the plugins in this Suite, the **Binaural Renderer**, requires Python to be installed.
          If you donâ€™t need to use that plugin, choose the **standard** installer .

          Otherwise, select the **full (Python x.x)** installer, being careful to select the one corresponding to the python x.x version you have installed or you want to install. e.g. if you are on MacOS and have Python version 3.6, install **Mac OS X 10.9 or higher (64-bit) - full ( Python 3.6 )**.

          If you have python already on your machine, you can see the python version by opening a command line prompt and typing the command:

          .. code-block:: bash

             python -V
