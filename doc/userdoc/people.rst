The VISR Production Suite has been made as part of the S3A project and it is based on the `JUCE <https://juce.com>`_ framework, which is a famous tool for easily generate DAW plug-ins in different formats, and on the `VISR <http://www.s3a-spatialaudio.org/visr>`_, a modular open-source framework for audio processing.

The people who were directly involved in the plugin development are:

* Giacomo Costantini - **main developer** (giacomo.costantini3@gmail.com)
* Andreas Franck - **VISR development and support** (a.franck@soton.ac.uk)
* Will Morris - **Reverb Object development and support** (w.d.morris@surrey.ac.uk)

Moreover, many of the S3A researchers were involved in the scientific research aspects behind the development of some of the plugins, and helped the developers providing concrete use cases and participating to the beta testing.
